# Changelog

All notable changes to elisprs are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions track `Cargo.toml`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Regexp support: `string-match` / `string-match-p`, `match-beginning` /
  `match-end` / `match-string`, `match-data` / `set-match-data`,
  `replace-regexp-in-string` (with `\&` / `\N` template expansion),
  `regexp-quote`, and the `save-match-data` macro. Elisp regexp syntax (`\(`
  grouping, `\|` alternation, `\{m,n\}` bounds, `\<`/`\>` boundaries, `\w`/`\s-`
  classes) is translated to the backing `regex` engine in `src/regexp.rs`; match
  data is char-indexed to match Emacs. Pattern backreferences (`\1`) are rejected
  rather than silently mismatched (the engine does not backtrack).
- `elisp --lsp` — a Language Server over stdio: positioned reader-error
  diagnostics, completion, hover, document symbols, and signature help.
- `elisp --dap` — a Debug Adapter over stdio: top-level-form breakpoints,
  stepping, `stackTrace` / `scopes` / `variables` / `evaluate` against the live
  `ElispHost`, with the debuggee's stdout captured through a pipe so program
  output streams as `output` events instead of corrupting the JSON-RPC channel.
- JetBrains plugin (`editors/intellij`) — Emacs Lisp lexer, `.el` / `.emacs`
  file types, `;;` commenter, paren/vector brace matcher, paren-balancing
  smart-enter, elisp new-file templates, color page, and LSP/DAP/run wiring.
- `release.yml` — tag-triggered multi-target binary builds, GitHub Release
  publishing, and Homebrew tap auto-bump.
- `completions/_elisp` — zsh completion for the `elisp` CLI.

### Fixed
- Bytecode cache invalidation: the `~/.elisprs` shard key now folds in a
  fingerprint of the builtin object layout and the prelude source, so adding or
  reordering subrs (or editing the prelude) no longer serves stale chunks that
  resolve builtin handles to the wrong objects. Previously only an elisprs
  version bump invalidated the cache.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Milestone-1 runtime: an elisp-correct reader, a compiler that lowers each
  top-level form to a `fusevm::Chunk`, and an `ElispHost` object heap reached
  through fusevm's extension handler — no bespoke VM or JIT.
- `Value::Obj` heap handles for cons / symbol / vector cells.
- ~65 primitive subrs (lists, arithmetic, predicates, strings, I/O, functional).
- Special-form lowering: `quote` `function` `if` `when` `unless` `and` `or`
  `progn` `setq` `let` `let*` `lambda` `defun` `defmacro` `while` `cond` …
- The `elisp` binary: run a file, `-e EXPR`, and a REPL.
- README (house template), `docs/` (reference + engineering report), and man
  pages (`elisp.1`, `elispall.1`).
